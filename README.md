# What is Largo ?
Algorand is a late-generation blockchain that features a set of exciting qualities, including high scalability and a no-forking consensus protocol based on Proof-of-Stake. The Algorand smart contract model aims to mitigate smart contract risks and embraces a non-Turing-complete programming model, natively supporting atomic sets of transactions and user-defined assets. This serves to standard industry practices; however, there is a big drawback: there are no practical security analysis tools (e.g., static or dynamic analyzers, or security fuzzers) to concretely analyze, identify, and report hidden vulnerabilities in the smart contracts and take advantage of the CICD pipelines to produce high-quality and secure code to the community. Therefore, currently building security contracts and decentralized applications for the Algorand blockchain heavily relies on the developers' security experience, which is not the case in most instances. 
Given the issues as mentioned above, this proposal aims at introducing the first free open-source and easy-to-use security fuzzing tool, called "Largo",  for Algorand communities to perform automated security fuzz testing and develop highly secure and reliable smart contracts on top of the Algorand network without having security knowledge or struggling with sophisticated configurations.
